## 作品原文
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show<sup>1</sup>,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow, —

They rightly do inherit<sup>2</sup> Heaven's graces,
And husband nature's riches from expense<sup>3</sup>;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others, but stewards of their excellence.

The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to itself<sup>4</sup> it only live and die;
But if that flower with base infection meet<sup>5</sup>,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:

For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.

## 译文
### 梁宗岱 译
谁有力量损害人而不这样干，
谁不做人以为他们爱做的事，
谁使人动情，自己却石头一般，
冰冷、无动于衷、对诱惑能抗拒——

谁就恰当地承受上天的恩宠，
善于贮藏和保管造化的财富；
他们才是自己美貌的主人翁，
而别人只是自己姿色的家奴。

夏天的花把夏天熏得多芳馥，
虽然对自己它只自开又自落，
但是那花若染上卑劣的病毒，
最贱的野草也比它高贵得多：

极香的东西一腐烂就成极臭，
烂百合花比野草更臭得难受。

## 我的感想
这首诗给人的感觉就远不止是爱情了。人的好名声的毁损也是同样的。

<sup>2</sup> （原注）*rightly do inherit*, etc.: 'it is right that they should be endowed with supreme beauty.'
<sup>3</sup> （原注）*from expense*: 'from being expended.'
<sup>4</sup> （原注）*Though to itself*, etc.: i.e. that which is sel-contained and self-centred will yet give pleasure if it be beautiful. The 'only' is misplaced, as so often in English; it goes with 'to itself.'
